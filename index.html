    <h2>Traffic Jams</h2>
    <p>
      Traffic jams are a pervasive issue in urban areas worldwide, causing significant disruptions to daily life and the
      economy. These logjams are a result of a complex interplay of factors including increased vehicle ownership,
      inadequate
      infrastructure, and poor traffic management. Addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach that
      encompasses
      infrastructural improvements, better public transportation, and responsible driving behavior.

    <h2>Increased Vehicle Ownership:</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      The most significant factor contributing to traffic congestion is the rise in the number of vehicles on the road.
      As
      populations grow and economies expand, more people are able to afford private vehicles, leading to a surge in
      traffic volume.
